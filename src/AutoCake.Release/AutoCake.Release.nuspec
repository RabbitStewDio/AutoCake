    <description>
This package contains a git-flow based release template. Starting from either the develop branch or an release-branch, this script will attempt to validate a release build.  
The script uses GitVersion to calculate the release version number and takes care of all the necessary branching and tagging during the build.
Building happens via a Cake action, and normally simply calls out to the standard 'build.cake' file for the project.
If successful, it will merge that release into the master-branch and rebuild the actual release to create the release artefacts. On success of that step, the release branch will be merged back into the develop branch to start the next development cycle.
If the release fails, this script will undo all changes to master, but will leave the release branch open so that the release can be fixed. Subsequent release attempts will reuse the existing release branch, even if started from the develop branch.
